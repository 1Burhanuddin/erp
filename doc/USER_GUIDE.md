## 1. Getting Started
Access the ERP via your web browser.
*   **Login**: Enter your registered email and password.
*   **Role Redirect**:
    *   **Admins/Owners**: Redirected to the Main Dashboard (Desktop View).
    *   **Employees**: Redirected to the Mobile Dashboard (Simplified View).

## 2. Dashboard Overview
Upon logging in as an Admin, you are greeted by the **Main Dashboard**.
*   **Key Metrics**: View real-time Total Revenue, Active Orders, and Inventory Alerts.
*   **Quick Actions**: Use the Sidebar or Global Search (Command+K) to navigate quickly to Sales, Purchases, or Settings.

## 3. Multi-Store Management
Your ERP supports running multiple branches or store locations from a single account.
*   **Switching Stores**: Use the **Store Switcher** icon at the top of the screen (Header) to toggle between different store views. All data (Sales, Employees, Inventory) updates to reflect the selected store.
*   **Adding a Store**: Go to **Settings > Stores** and click "Add Store". You can define the store name, location, and geofencing radius.

## 4. Employee Management
Manage your workforce effectively, tracking attendance and tasks.

### Adding Employees
Navigate to **Employees > All Employees** and click "Add Employee".
*   **Store Assignment**: vital for multi-store setups. Assign the employee to a specific branch.
*   **Role**: Choose 'Admin' for full access or 'Employee' for mobile-app only access.

### The Employee Mobile App
Employees access a specialized mobile-friendly interface designed for phone screens.
*   **Dashboard**: Shows shift status, pending tasks, and today's attendance.
*   **Navigation**: A floating bottom bar provides quick access to Home, Tasks, Attendance, and Profile.
*   **Sidebar**: Hidden by default on mobile to save space, but accessible for Admins.

### Geofenced Attendance
Ensure employees are physically present at the store before checking in.
*   **How it works**: The app checks the employee's GPS location against the Store's defined coordinates.
*   **Geofence Radius**: Configurable in Store Settings (default 100m).
*   **Verification**: The "Swipe to Check In" slider remains DISABLED until the employee is within range.

## 5. Inventory & Products
Keep track of stock levels and granular product details.
*   **Products**: Add products with Purchase Price, Sale Price, Tax settings, and Images.
*   **Variants**: Use Attributes (Color, Size) to create variances.
